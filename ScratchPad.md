Quantitative aspects of performance testing are gathered during the monitoring phase. Letâ€™stake
a closer look at main terms used in performance monitoring.

Two of the most important measures of system behavior are bandwidth and throughput.

*Bandwidth* is a measure of quantity, which isthe rate at which work can be completed, whereas
throughput measuresthe actualrate at which work requests are completed.

*Throughput* can vary depending on the number of users applied to the system under test. It is
usually measured in terms of requests persecond. In some systems, throughput may go down
when there are many concurrent users, while in othersystems, it remains constant under pressure
but latency beginsto suffer, usually due to queuing. How busy the variousresources of a
computersystem get is known astheir *utilization.*
